## Summary of qualifications

I have 10+ years of experience in software development. I started my jorney with Pascal/Delphi for 5 years. Then 7+ years I worked with Java stack. And 2 years mostly with groovy and last couple of month (up to year) with TypeScript/React/NodeJS. Aftewards I worked last year as an architect with Java project.

I've been working as a Software Architect/Tech lead, for last year. Despite driving main project I was involved in different consultancy and investigation activities. I have strong technical experience of Software Development processes, including analysis, requirements design, data modeling, coding, testing, debugging using Java. Also I had some experience with Typescript/React/NestJS.

I'm interested in development of reliable and maintainable software. However I understand that we have wide range to reach business needs. I have experience in development of complex business models using modern TDD and BDD approaches. Setting up code quality and test quality standards in the team. I'm fast learner and passionate to learn new ideas and technologies.

I really like to create own tools which I need and can't find suitable (see my open-source projects). Also I like to share knowledge on online and offline meetups (see my publications)
My hobbies used to be jogging, programming and electronics and also hiking. I like car traveling, aviation, and fantasy movies and books
